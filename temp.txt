Tips:
Strategy 1: Game of 24
1. Start with multiplication. If the result is too high, try random combinations of addition, subtraction, and division.

Strategy 2: Recipes
1. Start by searching for the aesthetic or theme of the holiday, and only then look for the recipes.


Algorithm (structured):
Algorithm 1: Game of 24
1. Break down the numbers into two pairs like so: (a_b)_(c_d) where each underscore represents a math operation
2. Use one of the four basic operations (*, /, +, or -) between each number and pair
3. Evaluate the result. If it evaluates to 24, you are done. If not, repeat steps 1-2 with different orderings.

Algorithm: Game of 24
Given n numbers (stored in array A), can you use arithmetic to arrive at x?

If n = 1:
If A[0] = x, then yes
If A[0] != x, then no
If n = 2:
Try multiplying the two numbers
Try adding the two numbers
If x >= 0
Try subtracting the smaller from the larger
Else try subtracting the larger from the smaller
Try dividing the larger by the smaller
If any of those work, then yes. If not, then no solution.
Try adding all the numbers in A together.
Try multiplying all the numbers in A together.
If there are factors of x in A, pick one.
Prefer 1 as a factor of x, and then prefer smaller factors
See if the other n - 1 numbers can make the other factor of x
If so, then yes
If not, then pick another factor
If there are no more factors of x in A, then for each number a in A:
SUBTRACT a from x
Prefer even numbers
See if the other n - 1 numbers can form the result
If so, then yes
If not, try the next number
If that fails, then for each number a in A:
ADD a to x
Prefer even numbers
See if the other n - 1 numbers can form the result
If so, then yes
If not, try the next number
If that fails, then for each number a in A:
MULTIPLY x by a
Prefer smaller numbers
See if the other n - 1 numbers can form the result
If so, then yes
If not, then no solution
