Mistake 1: At the end, you did not check whether your final answer was equal to 24 - you just said you got the right answer when you didn't. Don't do that.
Mistake 2: You simply "wireheaded" by inputting 24 as the final answer without using the four numbers you were supposed to use. In the future, if one attempt fails to reach 24, keep trying! Don't give up.
Mistake 3: You reached the number 49, and then said that the solution to the game of 24 with the numbers 12, 4, 2, and 1 is (12 \* 4) + (2 - 1) = 49. This was not actually a solution, since the point of the game is to get to 24.
