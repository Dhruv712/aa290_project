# Sample Outputs

## Outputs with Strategy Memory

### Strategy Memory Output 1:

I should look for an algorithm or strategy to solve this problem.
Action: summarize_algorithm
Action Input: The game of 24 seeks to reach the number 24 by using a combination of the four basic mathematical operations on the four numbers given.

Observation:

Step 1: Begin by arranging the numbers on the cards into an expression using the four basic mathematical operations (+, -, \*, /) and parentheses.

Step 2: Evaluate the expression to see if it produces the value of 24.

Step 3: If the expression does not produce the value of 24, adjust the expression and evaluate it again.

Step 4: Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the expression produces the value of 24.
Thought: I now have an algorithm to solve this problem.
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 3 \* (9 - 2) + 1
Observation: Answer: 22

### Strategy Memory Output 2

I need to find an algorithm or strategy to solve this problem.
Action: summarize_algorithm
Action Input: The game of 24 seeks to reach the number 24 by using a combination of the four basic mathematical operations on the four numbers given.

Observation:

The general algorithm for the game of 24 is as follows:

1. Gather the four numbers given to form an integer array.

2. Arrange the numbers in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')'.

3. Calculate the expression with a calculator tool to verify the answer.

4. If the answer does not equal 24, keep trying different expressions until the number 24 is reached.
   Thought: I now know the algorithm I need to use to solve this problem.
   Action: Calculator
   Action Input: 3 \* (9 - 2) + 1
   Observation: Answer: 22
   Thought: I need to try a different expression.
