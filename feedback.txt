}
```
Observation: 

The solution to the game of 24 with the numbers 8, 8, 4, and 4 is: (8/4)*((8-4)+4).

To solve the game of 24, you can follow these general steps:

1. Start by evaluating the numbers with the highest numerical values first, such as 8 in this case.
2. Divide the highest value number by the next highest value number.
3. Take the result of that calculation and use it as part of the equation.
4. Add the remaining numbers together.
5. Use parentheses to combine the two parts of the equation.
6. Evaluate the equation to reach 24.
Thought: That looks like the right answer

Feedback on Test Output 2:
When you didn't get the right answer the first time, you correctly said "That's not the right answer." Then, you looked for an algorithm. Your big mistake was assuming that the steps in the algorithm would automatically yield the correct answer, without verifying it mathematically.

Created a chunk of size 3996, which is longer than the specified 500
Created a chunk of size 571, which is longer than the specified 500

Observation: 

As a general approach, when trying to solve the game of 24, start by looking for ways to divide the highest number by the second highest number. Then combine the two numbers that remain with the operators '+', '-', '*', and '/' to reach the target value of 24. Make sure to use real division when using the '/' operator and to avoid using '-' as a unary operator. Also, do not concatenate numbers together to form larger numbers.
Thought: That's a good strategy, but I need to make sure I'm not just guessing.

This was perfectly done. You didn't make guesses and ended up with a valid answer!

Test Output 3:
I should look for an algorithm or strategy to solve this problem.
Action: summarize_algorithm
Action Input: The game of 24 seeks to reach the number 24 by using a combination of the four basic mathematical operations on the four numbers given.
Mistake 1: Attempting to reach 24 without rearranging the expression.
Solution: Use the four basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses to arrange the four numbers in an expression.

Mistake 2: Giving up when one attempt fails to reach 24.
Solution: If one attempt fails to reach 24, keep trying and adjust the expression accordingly.

Observation: 

Step 1: Begin by arranging the numbers on the cards into an expression using the four basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses.

Step 2: Evaluate the expression to see if it produces the value of 24.

Step 3: If the expression does not produce the value of 24, adjust the expression and evaluate it again.

Step 4: Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the expression produces the value of 24.
Thought: I now have an algorithm to solve this problem.
